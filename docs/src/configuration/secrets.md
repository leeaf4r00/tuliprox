# 🔐 Secrets & Environment Variables

Every deployment needs credentials: provider logins, output-user passwords, webhook tokens, web server secrets.
Tuliprox keeps the repository free of real credentials while making it easy to inject them at runtime.

> **Host-agnostic.** These instructions deliberately do not assume any particular host, container platform, or
> cloud provider. Secrets are read from the process environment and from files we generate on the machine itself,
> so the same workflow works whether you run a container, a service manager, a process supervisor, a small server,
> or a hosted secret store of your choice. The mechanism to supply an environment variable is always the same:
> it must be present in the environment of the `tuliprox` process at startup.

Anything a provider, a player, a notification bot, or a browser authenticates with is a secret and must not be in git.

## `${env:VAR}` interpolation

Every config file that Tuliprox reads (`config.yml`, `source.yml`, `api-proxy.yml`, `mapping.yml`, `template.yml`)
supports environment-variable interpolation with the syntax:

```text
${env:VAR_NAME}
```

Variable names match `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`.

- **How it works:** the placeholder is resolved *before* the file is parsed as YAML, from the environment of the
  running process. If the variable is missing, Tuliprox logs
  `Could not resolve env var 'VAR_NAME'` and leaves the literal `${env:VAR_NAME}` in place so the problem is visible.
- **Quoting:** keep string values quoted, exactly like the value the variable will expand to:

  ```yaml
  inputs:
    - name: provider
      type: xtream
      url: "${env:CLOUDTV_URL}"
      username: "${env:CLOUDTV_USER}"
      password: "${env:CLOUDTV_PASS}"
  ```

  This stays valid YAML before and after substitution.
- **Use only for string fields.** Numbers (`exp_date`, ports, `token_ttl_mins`) and booleans (`enabled`) still belong
  directly in the file; injecting them through env vars is fragile.
- **Not supported in `user.txt`.** Web UI credential files are read directly and must be written on the machine
  (see below).
- **Also works in CLI paths:** any `--home` / `-c` / `-i` / `-a` argument can be `${env:...}` too.

### `.env` file support

Tuliprox automatically loads environment variables from a `.env` file at startup. This makes it easy to keep protected
credentials in a local `.env` file without committing them to source control (the repository's `.gitignore` already
ignores `.env` and `.env.*`). A sample template is provided at `config/.env.example`.

#### Discovery and precedence

Tuliprox searches for a `.env` file in the following order:

1. **Explicit CLI argument or environment variable:** `-e, --env-file <PATH>` or `TULIPROX_ENV_FILE=<PATH>`.
   If explicitly specified, the file must exist and have valid syntax; otherwise Tuliprox exits with an error.
2. **Config file directory:** if `-c <PATH>` was provided, the parent directory of that file (e.g. `<config_file_dir>/.env`).
3. **Config directory:** `<config_path>/.env` (default: `<home_path>/config/.env`).
4. **Home directory:** `<home_path>/.env`.
5. **Current working directory:** `./.env`.

The first matching file found is loaded.

#### Docker usage

There are three common ways to use `.env` files with Docker:

- **Automatic via mounted `config` directory (Recommended):**
  If your `docker-compose.yml` mounts `./config:/app/config`, simply place your `.env` file at `./config/.env` on the host.
  Because Tuliprox starts with `-p /app/config`, it automatically discovers and loads `/app/config/.env` at startup.

- **Custom location via `TULIPROX_ENV_FILE`:**
  If your secrets file is located elsewhere on the host, mount it into the container and point the `TULIPROX_ENV_FILE`
  environment variable to it:

  ```yaml
  services:
    tuliprox:
      image: ghcr.io/euzu/tuliprox:latest
      environment:
        - TULIPROX_ENV_FILE=/secrets/tuliprox.env
      volumes:
        - /etc/secrets/tuliprox.env:/secrets/tuliprox.env:ro
        - ./config:/app/config
  ```

- **Native Docker Compose `env_file:` directive:**
  Docker Compose can directly populate container environment variables from a `.env` file on the host without mounting:

  ```yaml
  services:
    tuliprox:
      image: ghcr.io/euzu/tuliprox:latest
      env_file:
        - .env
  ```

#### 12-factor rules: Existing environment variables take precedence

Variables already defined in the system or container environment (e.g. via `export VAR=value`, Docker `environment:`,
or Kubernetes secrets) **are never overwritten** by a `.env` file. The `.env` file serves as a default/fallback
configuration.

#### ⚠️ Restart required on change (no dynamic hot-reload)

> **Important:** Changes to `.env` files do **not** take effect dynamically via configuration reload.
> For mounted `.env` files or bare-metal installations, restart the `tuliprox` service or container
> (`docker compose restart`). When using Docker Compose `env_file:`, recreate the container
> (`docker compose up -d --force-recreate`) to apply changed values.
>
> *Why:* In Rust, modifying environment variables in a multi-threaded runtime (`setenv`) is inherently
> not thread-safe and can cause undefined behavior or data races with concurrent readers. `.env` values are loaded
> strictly once at application startup and require a restart to change.

### Other ways of supplying variables

Because Tuliprox resolves from the process environment, any standard mechanism works alongside or instead of `.env`:

- `export TULIPROX_WEB_SECRET=...` in the shell / init script that starts the process,
- `environment:` entries in a container or compose file,
- `Environment=` lines of a service unit,
- the secret store / environment settings of whatever runtime you picked.

## Web UI credentials (`user.txt`)

Tuliprox stores password *hashes*, never plain text. Each line is `username:argon2_hash[:group1,group2]`; without
groups the user defaults to `admin`.

1. Generate a hash with the interactive CLI prompt (it needs a real terminal and cannot read from stdin):

   ```bash
   tuliprox --genpwd
   ```

2. Write the line into `config/user.txt` (or the user file configured in `config.yml`):

   ```text
   myuser:$argon2id$v=19$m=19456,t=2,p=1$...
   ```

3. Restart the server (or reload) and verify the login.

`user.txt` is environment-injectable only in the sense that the *path* may come from a CLI/`${env:...}` path; the
hashes themselves are generated on the machine and are never committed. The `config/user.txt` shipped in this
repository contains sample hashes for the demo accounts `test` / `nobody` documented in `config/README.md` — replace
them before going live.

## JWT secret (`web_ui.auth.secret`)

If `web_ui.auth.secret` is omitted, Tuliprox generates one in-memory and **all active logins are invalidated on every
restart**. For production, pin a static 64-character hexadecimal string and keep it stable:

```bash
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

Put the result in an environment variable and reference it from `config.yml`:

```yaml
web_ui:
  auth:
    secret: "${env:TULIPROX_WEB_SECRET}"
```

Rotating it invalidates all sessions — do it deliberately, not on a whim.

## Pre-publish checklist

Run these before pushing anything to a public repository:

```bash
# Anything obviously credential-like in tracked configs
git grep -n -i -E "(password|secret|token|api_key)[[:space:]]*:" -- config/

# Explicit values that should have been placeholders or generated on-site
git grep -n -i -E "your_|TODO|changeme|example|\.secret|localsecret" -- config/

# Staged files (never a secret should be here)
git diff --cached --stat
git status --porcelain
```

Other good habits:

- Keep `logging.sanitize_sensitive_info: true` (default). It masks passwords, provider URLs and client IPs in logs
  so shared logs can't leak credentials.
- Keep `runtime_config_report_enabled: false` unless you need a startup dump; when enabled it masks sensitive values
  as `***` anyway.
- Never commit `data/`, `target/`, `downloads/`, `cache/`, `backup/`, `.env`, or any runtime directory — the
  repository `.gitignore` already covers the common ones.
- If a secret ever lands in history, rotate it (it is compromised history, not just a file) and rewrite history
  with `git filter-repo` rather than committing new secrets on top.
